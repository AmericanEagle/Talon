Talon - An Americaneagle.com Toolkit
==========

**Currently stable for Node v6.3.0**


##Installation/Setup

To install this package - first ensure you are running Node v6.3.0 on your machine. 

 1) Download the contents of the repository to your local machine

 2) Open up the folder from explorer and type 'cmd' to access the command prompt
 
 3) In the command prompt, type 'npm install' to get all necessary dependencies

Once completed, you can now choose how you want to run Gulp.

 1) Type 'gulp' to run the standard gulp task. This will compile all files on initial run and is a good task to run if you are just starting the project.

 2) Type 'gulp watch' if you do not want the files to compile initially, but want the gulp task to watch your files as you make updates. This is significantly quicker and good if you are picking a project back up.

 3) Type 'gulp templates' if you are going to be cutting HTML templates. This will run browsersync which will allow you to have a local environment with auto refresh of your HTML templates.


##TODO
 - Include more accessibility features
